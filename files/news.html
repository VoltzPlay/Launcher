			<h1>Railcraft 9.6.0.0</h1>
			<p>Here is what you’ve all been waiting for! Railcraft 9.6 is here!</p>
			<p>For those of you who have updated Forge recently, this update should resolve all your issues involving Fluids. It also includes support for IFluidContainerItems!</p>
			<p>This update will also see the much improved new Switch code fron ssotangkur. They should be more reliable than ever!</p>
			<p>And of course there a whole host of other improvements and bugfixes. Not a huge amount of new features, but I got caught up in a slew of bugfixes. The bigger the mod gets, the more time I have to spend doing bugfixes instead of new features, sad day!</p>
			
			<p><strong>Changelog:</strong></p>
			<ul>
				<li>INFO: Full support for the latest Forge Fluid changes, also fully backwards compatible with older versions. May require some config tweaks for older versions.</li>
				<li>NEW: Removed Forestry API files from the JAR to increase compatibility and reduce conflicts. All Forestry integration remains functional. (experimental)</li>
				<li>NEW: You can now reset the Signal Tuner and Signal Block Surveyor by sneak-clicking.</li>
				<li>NEW: Add Passive Anchor, does not force load chunks on game load, only when visited. Recipe uses Cyan Dye for now, but will eventually use Prismarine.</li>
				<li>NEW: IFluidContainerItems should be completely supported now.</li>
				<li>NEW: Add Debug in-game command that will dump data to the logs.</li>
				<li>NEW: Capacitor Boxes now have a switch to determine if they should trigger on a rising or falling signal. (contribution by wshadow)</li>
				<li>NEW: Improvements to the Switch code that should make them more reliable and predicable. (contribution by ssotangkur)</li>
				<li>CHANGE: Loaders "Has Work" Buildcraft trigger should better reflect the actual loader status. Issue #535</li>
				<li>CHANGE: Signal Block Relay Boxes now require two Signal Circuits in the recipe instead of just one.</li>
				<li>CHANGE: Signal Block Relay Boxes no longer function as a Controller. If you need that functionality, put a Controller Box next to it. May break some setups.</li>
				<li>CHANGE: Improve Signal Block debug print statements to help with debugging some possible issues.</li>
				<li>CHANGE: Coke Block now 10x Coal Coke fuel value and is flammable. (contributions by daniel and Kamran)</li>
				<li>FIX: Various chat messages that didn't before should now properly localize.</li>
				<li>FIX: Personal Anchors should only tick their update (and fuel use) function once per tick...oops.</li>
				<li>FIX: Fix Geode Generator. Issue #576</li>
				<li>FIX: Geodes should only spawn under the ocean floor now, instead of half submerged. Issue #526 (contribution by liach)</li>
				<li>FIX: Melt snow on top of Smokers. Issue #530</li>
				<li>FIX: The Controller Box shouldn't respond to redstone signals that don't update it. Issue #539</li>
				<li>FIX: Tanks should now properly sync with the client again. Issue #545</li>
				<li>FIX: Don't register research if Thaumcraft crowbars aren't defined. Issue #546</li>
				<li>FIX: Invalid Multi-blocks should reject items. Issue #557</li>
				<li>FIX: Fixed NPE when breaking a cart on a Routing Detector. Issue #562</li>
				<li>FIX: Engines should output to IEnergyReceivers in addition to IEnergyHandlers. Issue #564</li>
				<li>FIX: Signal Blocks should no longer ignore hills and valleys within the block.</li>
				<li>FIX: Fix Track Layer not dropping items and expand valid replaceable blocks (contribution by Yopu)</li>
				<li>FIX: Fix stack-over-flow on circular Train.</li>
				<li>FIX: SMP block sounds should work now (contribution by PaperTriangle)</li>
				<li>FIX: Newly spawned Anchor Carts should attempt to force load chunks immediately instead of waiting for an entityEnteredChunk event.</li>
				<li>FIX: Fixed localization issues with Track GUIs.</li>
				<li>FIX: Disabling the Factory Module should no longer prevent you from cooking Abyssal and Quarried Stone.</li>
				<li>FIX: Attempt to make Train objects survive linking and cart deaths (unlinking still needs work).</li>
				<li>FIX: Anchor Cart should no longer request Chunkloader Tickets if the entity is dead.</li>
				<li>FIX: Crowbar should no longer attempt to link dead carts.</li>
				<li>FIX: Train Detector should no longer count dead carts as part of a Train. Issue #536</li>
				<li>FIX: Crowbar Destruction Enchantment can no longer perform alchemy. Issue #519 (contribution by WoodStone)</li>
				<li>FIX: Hide the Tank Valves Animation Tank from TankInfo calls. Issue #381</li>
				<li>FIX: Properly Handle Invalid Regex Syntax in Routing Tables. Issue #518</li>
				<li>FIX: Don't try to define Brick recipes if disabled. Issue #513</li>
				<li>FIX: Reduce logging levels so that more log messages get sent to the log file instead of the console.</li>
